            D3.js is an extensive library used to create visualizations for Da ta Driven Documents. Visualizing large sets of data allows any individual to notice certain information which may provide a benefit. An example would be using the pie graph visualizations for "Company A" (<u>Company's Collective Majors</u>), if you were the owner of this, let's say a small start-up company, which is involved in the online-medical market; you would notice maybe a lack of engineers within your company and would seek out to hire one for the benefit of the company.

        So if you're wondering why I decided to create an item involving D3, the main point is scientific visualization. UI and UX can be created on my end, but visualizing high-end graphics on data driven documents requires a lot of time and effort. The goal of programming for me is to minimize needless work; to not go out of my way spending hours on something I didn't need to spend hours on. D3 helps with that concept in mind (as with any library), and I'm sure it can also help you.

    <h3 align="center"> "Uh the charts are not completely loaded" (Limits and Cons of D3)</h3>
    <div id="containerText">
        <p>
        Using a browser other than Google Chrome and having trouble seeing all 4 pie graphs? That's because the browser is NOT able to load the JavaScipt data in-time before reading it. Hit refresh multiple times to see different graphs appear (or disappear), knowing the limits of JavaScript and libaries developed in JavaScript is one of my core concepts for web development, browsers on mobile phones and browsers on desktops will struggle when implementing JavaScript. Catering to the main audience and creating a all-working website is key in developing 'successfully working' JavaScript functions (since the SVG is not properly supported on an even basis on all browsers).

        The D3js.js is an open source code, feel free to modify it however you wish for your own purposes.
