## Code Example

Insert a CSV file following the format of:

"Company ID,Major,Standing,Performance,Intern,Department"

Example input: "101,Computer Science,Junior,82,N,B"


Simply running the code will produce a visualization

## Motivation

I had the idea because I wanted to provide visualization for company data which might help show results not seen before.
